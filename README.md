Automatic Differentiation for Solid Mechanics in Julia


This repository contains modules implementing an automatic differentiation systems for the solution of solid mechanics problems in [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).

- adiff.jl			 is the module implementing the automatic differentitation system in Julia
- materials.jl   is the module implementing the strain energy evalaution functions for the materials
- elements.jl    is the module implementing the energy evalaution functions for the single elements and for the model and the functions for solving a finite element problem
