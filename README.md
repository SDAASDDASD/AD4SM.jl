Automatic Differentiation for Solid Mechanics


This repository contains a number of scripts implementing an automatic differentiation systems for the solution of solid mechanics problems in [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).

- adiff.jl       is the script implementing the automatic differentitation system in Julia
- materials.jl   is the script implementing the strain energy evalaution functions for the materials
- elements.jl    is the script implementing the energy evalaution functions for the single elements and for the model and the functions for solving a finite element problem
